# organic-customer-classification
The task was to profile organic product customers and build a classification model to predict which customers were likely to purchase organics.
We were provided a data set with 13 columns and over 22,000 observations. To begin, an exploratory analysis was conducted to identify the attributes of customers who purchase organic products. A few questions considered were as following: Do males purchase more organics than females? Does age play a factor? 
The next step was to build a minimum of 4 classification models, using at least one logistic regression and one classification tree. The 'best' model was selected after comparing the accuracy, precision, and recall of the models. 
Finally, a slide deck containing the finidings and recommendations for delivery to a business audience was constructed.
